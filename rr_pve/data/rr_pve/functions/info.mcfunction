tellraw @s [{"text":"PVE mode is a singleplayer/co-op mode where the players go against the game itself, defending against waves of missiles spawned at different heights and increasing intervals using only the utility items in the base game. There's no way to win; all you can do is try your best to keep your nether portals safe for as long as you can. Your score is how long your nether portals were safe for, and the highest scorers have their names and score up on display in a leaderboard in the lobby!","color":"dark_purple","italic":"true"}]
