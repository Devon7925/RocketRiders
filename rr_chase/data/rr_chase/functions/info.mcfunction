tellraw @s [{"text":"In Chase Mode, everyone is on Blue team, but they must race against each other and prevent each other from reaching the Finish Flag on Yellow base with their given missiles and utility items. Utilities like the Vortex and the Nova Rocket work against players on the same team. Also, friendly fire is enabled and players get 4 arrows each time they respawn, so melee and ranged combat with the Shooting Saber is possible. Whoever makes it to the Finish Flag first wins the game!","color":"white","italic":"true"}]
