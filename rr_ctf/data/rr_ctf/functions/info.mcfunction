tellraw @s [{"text":"In Capture the Flag mode, there are no portals, bases are made of concrete, and players (equipped with Piercing Pickaxes) must travel to the enemy base and capture their flags (extra Canopies are given for easier travel). To capture a flag, break the purple glass block on either flagpole to lower it and walk to it to steal it. Once someone steals a flag, their missiles spawn in the other direction so they can go back to their own base and successfully capture the flag. The first team to capture both flags wins.","color":"white","italic":"true"}]
