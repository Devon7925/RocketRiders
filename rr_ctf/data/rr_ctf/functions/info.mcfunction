tellraw @s [{"text":"In Capture the Flag mode, there are no portals, bases are made out of concrete, and players (equipped with Piercing Pickaxes) must ride to the enemy base and capture both of their flags. To capture a flag, climb onto the enemy base and break the purple glass block on either flagpole to lower the flag, at which point it can be stolen. Once someone steals a flag, their missiles spawn in the opposite direction so they can go back to their own base and successfully capture the flag. The first team to capture both enemy flags wins.","color":"white","italic":"true"}]
