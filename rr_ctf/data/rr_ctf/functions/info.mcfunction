tellraw @s [{"text":"In Capture the Flag mode, there are no portals for you to destroy; instead, you must ride to the enemy base and capture both of their flags. To capture a flag, climb onto the enemy base and break the purple glass block on either flagpole to lower the flag; when the flag is lowered, it can be stolen. Once someone steals a flag, they carry a flag on their head and get a glowing effect. In order for them to get back to their own base and successfully capture the flag, missiles spawned by flag carriers spawn in the opposite direction. The first team to capture both flags wins.","color":"white","italic":"true"}]
